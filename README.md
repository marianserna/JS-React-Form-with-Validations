# JS React Form With Validations

This small project contains 4 components (pages). It was built for a school project and also as a way to practice Javascript and React. For the styling of the forms I have used Stylus (which compiles to CSS).

You can see this project which was deployed to Heroku at https://fast-anchorage-19393.herokuapp.com

## The Components

- Landing: Provides the Login and Sign Up links when the user first arrives... the home page.
- SignUp: Provides the signup form along with its validations. The user is then stored in local storage.
- LogIn: Provides logging in and validating the username/password against what is in local storage.
- Welcome: Provides a welcome message to the user after login or signup. User info is read from local storage.
