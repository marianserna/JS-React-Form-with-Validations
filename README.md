Hello mundo!

Welcome to my last project (at the time of writing this README). This is almost my first React project. Wohoo! It is the result of a very rushed school assignment.
We were tasked with creating a simple HTML form with JS validation. However I said...But why would I do this? I have already done this in a previous course. Aha! -I thought- I'm gonna do it as a React project! But...do I know React? Well, I didn't know much, I had been trying to do Wes Bos' React course and it was fun so I used his starter structure to create my own React project. And guess what, I submitted it just 2 minutes before the dealine.

Anyways, this was my first time using stylus, how fun! I learned a lot, but evidently I still have a long way to go.

A la prochaine!

xoxo!
